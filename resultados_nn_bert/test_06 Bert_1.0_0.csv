He appeared to be someone's pet as he was clean and neat. We later found out that he was left behind with two other dogs when his owner moved out. Mikey is friendly to human however he is territorial and doesn't enjoy mixing with other dogs/cats. He is a good guard dog and extremely alert. Our preference is for an experienced dog owner without any dogs or pets to adopt Mikey so he can adjust in well. Bull is energetic and athletic thus regular exercise is required. If you are interested, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) Neutering and vaccination has been done. We will be charging RM which is the total sum of his medical fee. 4) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 5) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 6) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive his progress update. 7) We would like to view the condition of your home before deciding. 8)During the initial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Mikey is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Mike cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. If you're interested to adopt Mikey, leave your comments below or contact me. Provide us your details (particular, type of house and experience with dogs)..",1.0,2,2

It was a stressful three months during the treatment period since he was not to be excitable for fear of getting a stroke. It was difficult because he was an energetic dog who gets happy and excited whenever we are around. Thankfully, he survived and has since been living a healthy life.

My friends from the neigbourhood and I decided to check him out after hearing his cry for a couple of days and noticed that he was an abandoned puppy with serious injuries. We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping ""Oreo"" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted ""Oreo"" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found ""Oreo"" in some where. Now, we have to put Oreo up for adoption again. I really hope that a kind person with love and care for animals will adopt Oreo and give him a comfortable live. He has gone through many hardship. From being abandoned to severe injuries, then adopted to be abandoned again.

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

Please contact my rescuer Aida at if you would like to adopt/foster me. Thank you! :) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (P/S: all potential adopters are required to fill in the adoption form and decision will be made after giving the answers/feedback careful consideration in favour of Mochi's current and future well-being.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------",6.0,2,2

They will be having fresh cooked tuna or tenggiri once a week. Body weight is 8.KG (Boy) & 7.KG (Girl). This weight is taken 1 1/2 hour ago before i create this post. For adopter information :- 1) I'm not selling pet - Both of them was given to me by a friend from New Zealand. Yes, im not buying it but the cost from New Zealand to Sarawak is more than Eur1k. 2)Why i charged for both of them? if someone couldn't afford to pay adoption fee then how my cat can live in good environment with new owner? 3)I will show you all certification about both of them. I will hold all documentation about cert/import document/certification document etc. unless you show me how are they for 3-4 months. If i can see they in good hand then i will release all document to new owner. If you ask why? I think everyone know the answer well. Now lets talk about reason : 1)My wife having our 2nd baby and always complaining about not feeling well. Including vomitting when smelling thier dry foods. 2)I tried to get relative's to handle them but most of them have aggressives guard and indoor dogs. 3)My cat never caged. Only in carrier or veterinary hospital for checkup. Thats the reason i couldn't send them to boarding till my wife give birth. That's it.. For Muslim's adopter do not feel worried about my cat. They tooked dry food only. Suppliment also halal product. Wet food once a week gm each of them is plain fresh fish without any ingredient or even fish bone. Giving together all 4 tiers cat tree/bed/pet food/grooming equiptment/shampoo/dry cleaner shampoo/accessories etc. Pet food can last 2-3 months. Warning : No seperate adoption.

Later that nite I went back to see if the mother came back. There's no sign the mother was with them and if I think back the box is damn small doesn't seems to fit in the mother so I came to a conclusion they were not dumped with the mother so I took them.

Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks!

My foster mummy spotted and picked me up immediately (despite my hissy protests). I was wrapped up in a towel, placed in a carrier and taken for a ride. ♥ Foster mummy could see that I wasn't the type to warm up easily. A single flinch from her would send me running to a corner! Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ♥ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ♥ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** ◘ Blake is not % secure yet. He dislikes any kind of hustle and bustle. For this reason, homes with active/young kids or crowded households will not be suitable. Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) ◘ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions. There are enough street-kittens like him out there and Blake does not wish to contribute to the whole problem. ;) ◘ Blake would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc), this is for his long-term welfare. The adoption fee listed above is to cover (only a small portion of) his medical expenses thus far. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Blake Jr. home, please drop me an email or message at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

He immediately paid a desperate call to pet rescuer, animal rights activist, and Pawse for a Cause founder, Seema Subash, for urgent assistance. She along with a member from her team, rushed to the site and rescued the puppies. They were only about palm-size at the time. Three months later, the puppies are still being fostered by her. They've received the required medical attention and have even been vaccinated. Seema is unable to permanently adopted Nemo and Dory because she already has other dogs in her care, pets who need her undivided attention. The brown puppy is female, while the white one is male.

She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around. Adopter who wants to have May must be a good pet owner who provides a loving home environment and healthcare complying to the following pet lover's requirements :- 1) Vaccinations 2) Neutering 3) Lots of TLC!

I wasn't able to take them the day I discovered them but after a guilty, sleepless night I went back to get them all. The mum, Bailey was and is unbelievably gentle and trusting from the start, and just wonderful (she's also looking for a home). She was incredibly skinny and had some skin issues but is now looking times better. Fast forward 5 weeks, after a five hour road trip to Johor Bahru, plenty of love, care and attention, these pups are now 2 months old and ready to find new loving homes. They have all been dewormed, weaned and are in very good health. As they have only just turned 2 months they are now due their first vaccinations, which I will do so the adoption fee is the cost of the vaccination.

He sheds due to the heat and will need daily brushing. He is NOT a watchdog as he doesn't bark at strangers. No tying up or caging. Requirements: Preferably a family who can keep him indoors. Must take him for daily walks. Has a yard for him to exercise in. Keep him indoors on hot days and at night. It will be good if you have a dog as a companion for him, but he is also ok as a single dog. If interested, call or sms: introduce yourself, where you stay and if you have any dogs.

Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

Looked very hungry so we tried feeding him some corn that i had bought, but he was very timid, he will not approach the food if we put the it on our palm, so we leave it on the floor and move away, and he ate them. When people go near him, he will run away too. There are many cars in that area, he can get knock down very easily. We managed to get him and send him to a dog shelter in Cheras. He is not aggressive at all, looks timid and insecure and did not make any noise (no barking). Unfortunately this dog shelter in Cheras is also very full, i begged them and they agree to temporary shelter him when I go look for fosterer or adopter.

My brother and I found this adventurous little boycat yesterday stuck in the engine of a motorbike at the Section 17 night hawker centre. We fished him out and cleaned him up, and he's turned out to be a really adorable, friendly, fun five-week-old (estimated) who loves to cuddle people and sleep with or on top of them. He has an almost all black coat with what looks like white or grey ""highlights"" of stripes on his head and chest. Even as I'm typing this right now, he's curled up in my lap. Nishi can eat solid wet kitten food already, and has a clean bill of health from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital; he just got dewormed today. Sadly I can't keep him because my parents won't let me, but PAWS and ASPCA and other sanctuaries I've tried appear to be full up. I'd rather not put him back on the street, though, so if you would like to or you know anyone who'd like to take him into your home, please send me a message! Thanks. I'm willing to help cover the cost of his adoption (vaccinations, neutering etc) if you would need help with it. If you don't intend to neuter him, I'm afraid that he cannot go with you.

He is looking for a good home and family that can love and treat him as part of the family. Husky Boy is still young and need love, patients and attention, so must take care him well. He is very alert and will guard your house faithfully in return for tender loving care (however if you're purely looking for a guard dog who you can tie in your porch all day long to take care of your house, Husky is not for you). He is cute and healthy, playful and very good with humans and other dogs. As he is used to being indoors and loves being around with people and having company. However, if you do have a big compound for him to run and play, he will love it too because he was very active. Terms and conditions for adoption are: 1)MUST be sprayed/neutered (Cost will be considered if sharing required) 2)MUST continue with his annual vaccinations. 3)Only suitable for landed properties as Husky needed a landed property with big compound to move around. 4)MUST NOT be caged or chained for long periods of time. 5)MUST be provided with sufficient shelter from sun and rain. 6)Must have proper food and water for him (No bones allowed) 7)MUST walked him every morning and evening. 8)Must be able to afford veterinary care if he falls ill. 9)Must upkeep monthly tick treatment and Heartgard prevention to prevent tick fever and heartworms (also to prevent tick infestation in your home and transmission of ticks to your family). 10)Not suitable for factory, workshop or farm use. 11)During the stage of adoption, do allow home visit or, email picture or sent what's app picture, so that as a rescuer, I can ensure that Husky Boy is adjustable well to his new environment with his new loving family in his forever home. If you can fulfill the above conditions then you are a suitable and caring adopter for Husky Boy. Please contact me at for more info of the above adoption. “Only serious adopters who can look after Husky Boy himself/herself will be entertained” because as a rescuer, I definitely don’t tolerate ‘Animal Cruelty’ Thank you for your kind consideration and understanding to the above terms and conditions.",2.0,3,3

Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",6.0,4,4

Now he's fine after extra care & treated for 2 months! (Treat under Lian Animal Clinic, Klang) It got microchip too. It have beautiful blue eyes. Active and energetic ! Loves outdoor & need time bring for walk once/twice a day (love running). He pull on leash as it natural for husky. Can be train because I tried before and still need more training. Skin sensitive(itching) still need care or treatment. Husky a large breed dog need a little of space. Husky is not as easy as you think. He don't obey anything you ask. If you loyal to it , he'll sure listen to you. Because he obey my parents than me. He good with kids too. Please take note, as mention he have maggot wound which is at his private part/ball. That wound is fully healed but recently we just found out there's red spot spotted under it ball which is diff area than his previous wound. Doctor doubt that in his last treatment didn't clean his wound properly which caused a chance that there might be another maggot. It can be cure by taking oral medication as his previous maggot wound healed after few weeks time. Its a shame that owner abandon this beautiful dog and I couldn't handle 2 dogs because I have Jack Russell & small space plus my old man don't really like big dog. Can only keep him until end of this month. Hope it can find the right owner soon as I not able to keep him for long. I don't want it end up in SPCA. I have tried my best and did what I had to do for helping this husky. Hope either of you who's good hearted can take care & love him forever. Please do not adopt if you are looking for PEDIGREE as this dog here need forever loving home. And for the dog medical fee purpose a minimum fee as stated above will be charge for adoption. Serious adopter can contact me and for the adoption fee can be nego too. Interest kindly contact me for more info.. You can come over to meet him first. Area Klang / Setia Alam / 1U dog park.

She has been given 1st n 2nd vaccination (18th june .) 3rd vaccination is due on 18th July . DOB 7th April Sometimes she sleeps for hours .. sometimes she runs around playing with her toys. Sometimes she comes to you hoping u would play fetch with her. She is a very adorable puppy Right now she is teething so she might be biting a lot . Just tell her NO sternly on t hings she cannot bite n she will sorta understand coz thats what i do but further training would be required Give her her dog toys to bite. Looking for pet lovers who are willing to adopt her n treat her well. Kindly contact me if u are interested.,4.0,2,2

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!",2.0,2,2

Tried many names but he responds to ""Dogdog"". Sits and shakes hand on command. Please help to foster or adopt this beautiful dog. I cannot do so because I live in a small apartment with another dog. Please do not hesitate to call or whatsapp me.",5.0,1,1

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily. I have thunder/fireworks Phobia! kindly contact me through facebook PM",4.0,4,4

He was just a tiny cuddly 2 month old pup then and absolutely irresistible. Even at that young age he showed his potential. He was well-behaved, toilet-trained, intelligent, and affectionate. Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.

However, we have no choice but to re-home Dodi because due to our careers, my wife and I are planning to start life anew overseas in a few months. Furthermore, recently the management of my condo have started to pressure the residents about keeping pets and I am concerned that it is only a matter of time before Dodi can no longer stay in my apartment :( If you are interested to adopt Dodi, we would like to meet and interview you first. If you are chosen as Dodi's new master (or is it slave?), our only request is that you send us fortnightly video updates for awhile so that we can monitor Dodi's welfare. Note: Priority will be given to adopters who have no other pets because Dodi is quite a ""solo"" cat and does not play too well with others. We worry that she may get very stressed or traumatised if forced to live with other cats or dogs.",4.0,1,1

For some reason, she (the female cat) decided to move her kittens to my place. When i found her, she was hiding in my shoe rack, so, i made them a place to stay; a box, with an old towel, a bowl of water and some kitten food. It was ok for the first 3 days. On the 4th day i noticed the female cat is away for a longer period than usual. As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement. Appreciate if some kind soul out there would adopt/foster these kittens, preferably someone with a mother cat who just gave birth and wouldnt mind additional members to the family. Update (): Coco and Spotty are on milk replacement diet. Took them to the vet,they're putting on weight which means they're healthy and they are also in good shape.

I love snuggling up for cuddles and belly rubs. Canine buddies make me super happy, I really love to play! Like most of my ilk, I'm a clownish doofus ready to amuse you with my silly antics. I'm potty-trained on grass when outdoors and walk nicely on a leash. Please don't tie me up or confine me unnecessarily cos I will protest rather loudly and persistently. I have a major, MAJOR oral fixation and will chew anything and everything I can get my pearly white chompers on so I hope you'll be patient with me, pretty please? Other than my penchant for destruction (my nanny calls me T-Rex, teehee!) I'm a lovely boy who'd really like a permanent home to call my own. Please drop my nanny a message and make my day!"" To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself including location - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :) SERIOUS ENQUIRIES ONLY. To prove that you have read and understood the listing including the information I have requested, please include this in the body of your email: ""I have read Chabee's listing properly and am fully aware of his issue with destructive chewing. Despite this, I am prepared to prevent or manage such behaviour."" Emails that do not provide info requested will not be entertained.",10.0,2,2

Anyone of you can please help me? Two weeks ago MPSJ dog catcher came over to catch stray dogs at my house area. One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too. She is very obedient coz I think she had an owner before. She is house trained. I kept her in my living room all this time to separate her from my existing dogs. She didn't destroy anything in my house and never pee and poop everywhere. She will howl when she needs to go toilet.",1.0,4,4

Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested. We can set up a meeting for you to meet them in person before deciding. Much love, Shakira, Oli, Shadoh and Peanut Bangsar, KL.",1.0,3,3

That’s because when I was 3 months old, I fell into a drain and couldn’t get out. I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it! And I’m not a big eater, so I’m pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy can’t keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I can’t. So I hope to have a loving home to go to – where I can bring life, joy and glee to my new family. I hope we meet soon!",2.0,3,3

Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.",11.0,2,2

Adoption requirement : a) Adopter will need to be patient and willing to spend time to train Nimbus. b) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. c) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. d) Provide necessary medical attention. e) Allow visitation for us to follow-up on Nimbus when requested. All potential adopters are welcomed to view Nimbus before deciding.",3.0,4,4

His owner although devastated never gave up on him. She provided everything she could so Angel can have a chance to live a normal life. Many would believe a dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep. As the owner is working and fearing Angel may hurt herself, he is currently living in a cage 24 hours a day. The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds. If you believe you can raise Angel and in return inspired others to care/raise blind puppies, please contact me for further details. “Blind Dogs See With Their Heart and Are Worth Loving”.",4.0,3,3

Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. They will be ready for adoption after they settle down, but I will screen potential adopters now. kittens can be adopted individually or together, I can deliver them to their new home within KL / Klang Valley Area. Please help to share around with your friend, any other rescue community platform will be fine, help them to find a forever home ! Serious adopters only.

His fur is medium length and quite fluffy. He also has a very long and elegant tail. Personality wise he is a sweetheart. Very affectionate (manja), no matter how I shoo him away he keeps on coming begging to be given attention :) and he is also obedient, he listened when I said he can't come into the house. Therefore, despite being so manja he is also very independent. I'm looking for someone to give him a loving forever home that he obviously so desperately craves for.

I had a very hard life. I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home. I am a very sweet girl , cheerful and playful dog. Please give me a chance to have a good life. Thank you.",7.0,3,3

He is a great companion especially for eldery person. He was found on the street looking extremely skinny and malnourished. His owner dumped him and the poor fella being a home pet wasn't able to fend for himself. He has been nursed back to health and ready for adoption. Adopter ideally needs to have large compound for the dog to run around and daily walk is needed. No adoption fee but we seek for kibbles to be donated to our food supply in feeding the strays. 2 bag of combo at RM each and you may donate more if wish to. This dog has special diet requirement. He has to be fed on grain free and we recommend wild avoderm salmon grain free. Our requirement is simple : a) Adopter must be an animal lover. We don't want the dog to end up again on the street. b) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. c) Provide necessary medical attention d) Plenty of exercise and daily walk. You can view the dog before deciding. Trial adoption is available.** If you keen to find out more, please contact me. ** Subject to terms and condition 1st update : The dog is currently on trial adoption. The family seems to like him very much. Thank you for your interest. If the dog is available for adoption, we will contact those who have put in their interest with us earlier. 2nd update : This dog has been a permanent family member of the foster.

I am about 4 months old. I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

We took him into our home and cared for him for a few weeks. Now, he's grown into a strong, active pup, always ready to wander and run around the compound. He's a docile, gentle pup with a strong spirit. He loves climbing on things and squeezing through tiny gaps and holes. Always playful and always up for a chase and a little warm hug. He also loves being carried around in my arms. Raw chewy hide, Hup Seng crackers, crunchy fresh vegetables and fruits are his favourite things to snack on. He also loves his dry mini kibbles twice a day. We found this puppy with his spirit broken and his body weakened by neglect. We nursed him to health, fed and comforted him and we have grown very fond of the little one. We hope that you can find it in your hearts to provide the little bouncy lad a loving and caring forever home.",11.0,1,1

They are probably 2-3 months old, I can't really tell, very friendly and playful, needless to say, extremely adorable. Their mother is owned by a security guard and is tethered to a little guard station in Bandar Seri Damansara area. She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed!

He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g.

On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

Carameow is about 5 to 6 months now and has been spayed. :) ................................................. Carameow and his siblings were rescued from an unfriendly house that they were hanging out at. We managed to the mom(spayed and released) but now the kitties need to find a good family. They’re about 3 ½ months old, and have been dewormed, de-ticked and will have their first vaccination soon. All three of them are not big fans of my rescue dog, Bobo, will scowl or hiss at her when she comes too near, otherwise, i think they just tolerate dogs. Carameow has very similar markings to his sister, Flan. While Flan has blotches of darker tone (with white undertone), Caramel’s darker tone covers almost his entire body. Like the other two kitties, he loves to run and play around the house, but sometimes bumps into boxes and things. He’s a bit of a clumsy cat. Am looking for a good family who will spay him and care for him. Please watsapp me at or email me at if you are interested. Thanks!",12.0,3,3

Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail.

Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times.

We used to give her car rides often too, so she loves it and doesn't panic while in it. Another lovable trait is that she almost behaves like a cat! She loves to keep her body close on an owner's leg, often sitting down or taking naps next to the closest human being. We hope someone will give her a home as we don't want to send her to adoption shelters. :(",2.0,4,4

Against all odds, this tough pup responded incredibly well to antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, making a miraculous recovery and not requiring surgery at all! His leg is fully healed and he runs around like nothing ever happened. Because of his rough start to life, Ringo has shown a maturity beyond his months.

Timtams are now part of a loving family of parents +3kids+a maid and loving the wonderful corner house with grass in the compound! ----- TimTams (one is Tim, one is Tam)- to make it easier to call them! Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs. NOTE: Will only entertain genuine adopters who'd take either one or both dogs as family pets. They get along well with other dogs. Tim once ran up to an Alsation in my neighbourhood and I thought he'd be minced meat, but they got along fine! Tam was badly injured (possibly by other dogs) when he was rescued, so he'd need responsible owners who'd make sure he's kept in a safe environment.",20.0,3,3

I saw her at the vet & thought that she looks like BOLT. Trust me, she really looks like smaller-eyes-version Bolt. This lousy pic of her doesnt justify how cute she is! My friend had adopted her for nearly 2 months. He gave up on her due to her extremely submissive nature. She does well with other dogs but not so much with human. This is because she used to be a strayed puppy before someone picked her up & sent her to the vet. My friend is not a patient owner. He doesnt like the fact that she runs away everytime we go near her. She loves eating & will only come to you when you have food. Although she is a very submissive dog, she still greeted us when we came back from work. At the moment, she is a dog's dog & not so much of people's dog. She doesnt bark much unless she is playing with other dogs. She gets along very well with one of my mongrel dog. So i assume that she has no problem getting along with other dogs. Please bear in mind that she is not a people's dog as she was a strayed dog previously. I m looking for a very patient & loving owner who is willing to spend time with her & take care of her so that she is not reluctant of interacting with human being. Pls do not give up on her due to her submissive nature. I believe that she will eventually gain more confidence & be a really good companaion!",12.0,3,3
